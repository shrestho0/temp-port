# Intro

mCMS (minimal content management system) is an application where a user can create their desired webpages with built in styling and has the facility to serving those webpages. This project was done as my university project for a course. This is available with two different tech stacks: `SvelteKit-PocketBase` version and `SvelteKit-SpringBoot` version.
